<h2>ARTIST STATEMENT</h2>
      <p>I am a visual creator with the ability to transformation any material at my disposal 
from one form to another to fit my ideology of the world I live in. I don’t limit 
myself to a style or medium I give focus to the inspirations that flock in within me 
developing concepts that are triggered by my own interaction with the 
surroundings  
I find more strength in reduction process sculpting and woodcut print making as it 
gives me an intriguing way of manipulating my figures subjects.  
I use the indigenous way of print making as I use manual way of pressing as it give 
me more connection to my work.  
My subjects are human forms with no gender attached to them because I believe 
we all beings under the sun. </p>
